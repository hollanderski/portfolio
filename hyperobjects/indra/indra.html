The web contains in its structure a new spatio-temporal model.
In particular, it replaces the hierarchical organization of 
information by a spatializing hypertext, sequential storage by a 
storage random access and the psychological movement of 
storytelling by the psychological movement across space.
The best image for the web is a graph. With node servers and 
edge connections, the web indexes its data by producing 
metadata. Far from being chaotic, these data are organized in an 
ecosystem way. Man exudes data, which self-regulates in 
clusters.<br>
Topological proximity is correlated with semantic similarity.
There is a match between the content and the structure of the 
web.The hyperlink brings the reader from one text to another, 
endlessly. This metonymic system is deployed laterally, rather 
than vertically. <br><br><br><br>

In Indra's net, data, by producing meaning, is negentropic.
Indra’s net is a hermeneutic platform which is more focused on 
the content of discussions than on individuals, allowing the 
constitution of groups of interpretations or affinities.
The construction of collective meaning takes precedence over 
individual interests.<br>
An interface directly exposing the graph structure of the data 
to users could highlight associations of ideas, to produce 
collective meanings by allowing users to become an observers of 
thoughts. <br>
Like an interactive, multi-user map, the discussions are linked 
according to their semantic proximity.
Grouping by cluster is done semi-automatically because it is the 
users who build their common data index using keywords,then the 
algorithm calculates the weight of the nodes accordingly to 
users' annotations.<br>
A new representation of time and space using 3D must keep 
conventional space-time references to allow the user to 
adapt,like a semiotic index to indicate the direction of 
reading. A Temporal Data Skeleton may become the successor to 
the horizontal timeline of cinema and the vertical timeline of 
papyrus.<br>
The symbolism of <span class='word' ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net">Indra's net</a></span> comes from a Buddhist concept I discovered in the book <span class='word' ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach">Gödel, Escher, Bach</a></span> from Douglas Hofstadter. 
Indra's network denotes the interconnection and the emptiness of 
the Universe. All Indra diamonds reflect each other endlessly. 
This is a good metaphor for a social network, which should 
ideally portray the holistic nature of the world.
