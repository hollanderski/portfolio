               Ninon Lizé Masclef is an hybrid artist and scientist working in Paris, France. Having grown up surrounded by archives and maps of underwater archeology, she developed a particular sensitivity to historiography. Later, studying computer science and philosophy, she weaves the link between technology and memory which will be the origin of her techno-aesthetic. She develops an aesthetic of information flows, a techno-aesthetic of the traces echoing with the derridian differance and the infra-thin of Duchamp.
               Her interdisciplinary work combines philosophy, psychoanalysis and epistemology. She tries to disclose the connections between Art and Science in the process of invention.
               Following the indiciary paradigm, she investigates the digital vestiges and reconstructs the memory of our time.
               She collects data as clues: a click, an image left on the internet, a gaze, a body offered to the sensors. She retemporizes the traces captured by technological devices to give a mean of access to its real referent : the self and the Other.
               Her art practice unites various media like installation, performance, 3D graphics, photogrammetry, text and sound. 
               She a singer and multi-instrumentalist attaching great importance in transmedia and noise experimentation.

             <!--   Ninon Lizé Masclef graduated from Michelet High School in Literature and Fine Art speciality. Afterwards, she completed a Master\'s degree in AI following the Humanities and Technology Bachelor at the University of Technology of Compiègne, with a minor in Digital Cultural Technologies. In the meantime she worked with the philosopher Bernard Stiegler as a consultant for the Research & Innovation Institute (IRI) of Centre Pompidou. In 2018, with cooperation with the historians of media at the National Audiovisual Institute of France (INA) she conceived transmedia indicators to analyse the corpus of the televisual archives since 1995. In 2019 she exhibited a video installation in Paris for the Young Creator Prize organized by Jennifer Flay (FIAC). Since 2020 she is a collaborator of the Emotion and Perception Lab of Jagiellonian University. From 2020 to 2021 she worked as a Research Assistant at Deezer R&D. This year she won the second prize of the creARTathon Paris-Saclay, with the tangible interface \"Latent organism\", exhibited in Paris at gallery Joseph Charlot. After this she was granted the Dassault Systemes Corporation scholarship to study the Fabricademy program at Fablab Paris-Saclay. -->

I am currently specialised in data mining and writing a mémoire about quantum computing.\n I completed the Humanities and Technology curriculum at the UTC. In the meantime I worked with the philosopher Bernard Stiegler as a consultant for the Research and Innovation Institute of Centre Pompidou.\n\n\nThe Humanities and Technology curriculum, which combines human sciences, scientific abstraction and programming, allowed me to develop my interest in interdisciplinarity.  I see computer science as the right medium to understand contemporary philosophical issues. \n My main theoretical interest is philosophy of technology. In particular, the reconfiguration of historiography by big data and digital traces appeals to me. \n Earlier this year, with cooperation with the historians of media at the National Audiovisual Institute of France I conceived transmedia indicators to analyse the corpus of the televisual archives since 1995. \n\n \n My art practise reunites various media like installation, 3d graphics, photogrammetry, text and sound. \n Last september I exhibited a video installation in Paris for the Young Creator Prize organized by Jennifer Flay.
