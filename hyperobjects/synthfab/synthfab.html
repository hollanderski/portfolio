During a workshop at Fablab Paris-Saclay facilitated by <span class='word' ><a href="https://www.marrs.io/">Jonah Ross-Marrs</a></span>, I built a mini sequencer and polyphonic synth. It is based on Elliot Williams' Logic Noise series from <a href="https://hackaday.com/2015/02/04/logic-noise-sweet-sweet-oscillator-sounds/"><span class='word' >Hackaday</span></a>. Check the git repo <a href="https://github.com/merlinmarrs/polyphonic-sequencer-synth"><img width="1.5%" src="images/git.png"></a><br>

The sequencer portion is an 8-bit looper using a 595 shift register (and a second 595 just to make the corresponding LEDs blink). Bits can be added in LOOP mode by pushing the BEAT button. Beats are automatically added in AUTO mode by synchronizing the CLK and DATA knobs at the far right. The green LED is connected to the CLK frequency.
<br>
The jumpers can trigger one of three notes everytime that corresponding LED flashes. The timber of each note can be varied by turning the pots marked A, B and C. The notes are passively mixed in a final stage and can be either output to the onboard buzzer or send to the 3.5mm audio out with OUT selected on the second slide switch.
<br>
The board can be powered by USB C or with a 5V power supply connected to the power header.<br><br><br><br>

 The PCB schematic was conceived on Eagle and laser cut in the Fablab Paris-Saclay.
