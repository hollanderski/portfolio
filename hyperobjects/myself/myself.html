    Selected for the Jeune Création prize organized by Jennifer Flay (FIAC), Ninon Lizé Masclef in collaboration with Félix Ramon, conceived the installation « My self is not enough ». The digital device challenges visitors to play the game of love with their own reflection. <br>The work is visible during exhibition « Roaming... » at Espace Niemeyer in Paris from September 5th to 22nd. <br>
The device includes a one-way mirror, screen, camera and a face tacking software. When the viewer approaches the mirror, a voice comes to meet them and offers to play a game. When the viewer tries to go away or stop focus his gaze, the machine begs them to stay by his side.<br>
 
Little by little, the viewer is pulled into an ambiguous monologue with the machine. <br>
Using the process of <a href="https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/mediatheory/keywords/interpellation/">interpellation</a> and apparatus, the installation is designed to lure the viewer into social interactions with the device, enticing them to study their own self-image and identity.
<!--It is the interpellation of apparatus, seducing force interfering our intimacy by capturing our attention. -->
